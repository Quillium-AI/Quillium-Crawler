# Project Governance

This document outlines the governance model for the Quillium project. It describes how decisions are made, how contributors can become maintainers, and how the project is structured.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Users

Users are community members who use Quillium. They contribute to the project by providing feedback, reporting bugs, suggesting features, and participating in discussions. Anyone can be a user.

### Contributors

Contributors are community members who contribute code, documentation, designs, or other work to the project. Anyone can become a contributor by submitting a pull request that gets merged into the codebase.

### Maintainers

Maintainers are contributors who have shown dedication to the project and have been given permissions to merge pull requests and make releases. Maintainers are responsible for reviewing contributions, guiding contributors, and ensuring the quality of the codebase.

### Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

The Technical Steering Committee is responsible for the overall direction of the project, approving major changes, and making decisions when consensus cannot be reached among maintainers. The TSC consists of maintainers who have been elected to the committee.

## Decision Making

### Consensus-Based Decision Making

The project aims to operate using a consensus-based decision-making process. This means that decisions are made through discussion and agreement rather than formal voting.

### Pull Request Approval Process

1. A contributor submits a pull request
2. At least one maintainer must review and approve the pull request
3. For significant changes, a discussion period of at least 3 days is recommended
4. If there are no objections after the discussion period, the pull request can be merged

### Conflict Resolution

If consensus cannot be reached on a particular issue, the matter will be escalated to the TSC for a decision. The TSC may use a formal vote if necessary, with a simple majority required for approval.

## Becoming a Maintainer

Contributors who have demonstrated a sustained commitment to the project may be nominated to become maintainers. The criteria for becoming a maintainer include:

1. Consistent contributions over a period of at least 3 months
2. Demonstrated understanding of the project's goals and codebase
3. Positive interactions with other community members
4. Willingness to mentor new contributors

Nominations for new maintainers can be made by existing maintainers and must be approved by the TSC.

## Code of Conduct

All participants in the project are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Violations of the Code of Conduct may result in temporary or permanent exclusion from the project.

## Changes to Governance

Changes to this governance document must be approved by the TSC. Proposed changes should be submitted as pull requests and will be subject to the same review process as other contributions.
